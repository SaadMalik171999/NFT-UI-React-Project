                Artists themselves become a platform. NFTs allow artistes,
                especially upcoming ones, to create an ecosystem that allows
                genuine fans to buy into their market.

                NFT gives all the power to creators. Anyone upcoming artiste can
                do their stuff on-chain, making them more independent and
                freeing them from unfavorable deals from record labels.
              </p>

                A positive NFT-fueled change in the music market can upstage
                crypto adoption at large.
